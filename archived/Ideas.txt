# GUI Idea
- script 1, 2, and 4 are hands off and could definitely run without ArcGIS Pro open
- only the mod scripts (3)  require the map
- we could use a light gui to run most the scripts, then open the proejct when needed

- some kind of hub
	- s

# issues
- there multiple points where calculate field fails for no reason
	- replace with arcgis api
	
	
3 mod script
- user provisions
	- scenario name
	- facility type
